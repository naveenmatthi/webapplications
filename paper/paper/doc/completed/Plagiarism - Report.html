Session Hijacking The most popular XSS attack vectors are stealing the victim's session cookies to hijack the victim's accounts.<br /><br /></span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This enables attackers to impersonate victim account and access any sensitive data or features on behalf of victims.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Stealing credentials The attacker will use HTML pages and JavaScript to steal customer credentials, instead of obtaining their cookies cloning the login page of</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> the web application and then using XSS attacker steal credentials from the user.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This situation is even more useful from an attacker's view, as they ultimately acquire plaintext credentials instead of expiring ephemeral session cookies.<br /><br /></span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Targeting Sensitive Data Another strong XSS attack vector is to use it to exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> private identifiable data or cardholder data) or to conduct unauthorized activities.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Key logger: Using JavaScript, all keystrokes entered by a user on a vulnerable site can be logged. For this purpose, Metasploit involves an off-the-shelf payload.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> There are also some commercial websites offering JavaScript software that records all visitor motions, clicks, mobile gestures, or input forms that can be used for</span><span id="n228" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> malicious reasons. Port scan: XSS is also an unexpected source for port scans to be initiated against a victim's internal network by accessing a vulnerable website.<br /><br /></span><span id="n229" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Web site defacement: Changing the visual appearance of a website vulnerable to XSS is one of the easiest and yet most efficient ways for attackers to target companies</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> or public organizations. Either this can take organizations to the spotlight for the improper reasons by using embarrassing pictures or hacktivism messages.</span><span id="n228" class="tooltip red_selection" title=" "> Mitigations In order to minimize the risks associated with XSS, developers should encode all fields when displaying them in the browser.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> In addition, ensure that user input is filtered properly, particularly in the case of special characters.<br /><br /></span><span id="n228" class="tooltip red_selection" title=" "> A common source of XSS are outdated third party libraries integrated in the code, and as such, update these to the latest stable versions.</span><span id="n228" class="tooltip red_selection" title=" "> As part of a defence in depth strategy, ensure that cookie properties (such as HttpOnly) and security headers, especially CSP, are set accordingly.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> On a higher level, ensure that security is properly integrated in all phases of the development process and that developers are aware of common web application vulnerabilities.</span><span id="n3" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Ultimately, regular penetration tests would help identify such flaws and improve the security stance of the web applications.<br /><br /></span>
